    <h1>Purpose of the Login Page
        The login page serves as a secure gateway for users to access personalized features or         
        resources within a web application. By entering valid credentials, such as an email ID and password,
         users can authenticate themselves, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access restricted areas of the application. Additional functionalities like "Remember Me" help enhance user experience by allowing users to stay logged in, while the "Forgot Password" option provides a recovery mechanism for those who might have forgotten their credentials. This design prioritizes both usability and security, featuring a visually appealing interface with a responsive layout and modern aesthetics.</h1>
